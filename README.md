<big><strong>WARNING: Unfinished Project</strong></big>
<br><br>

  This project is as yet unfinished, which means there can and will be issues.
  Getting this HomeLAB enviornment working in your QNAP will probably require tweaking and troubleshooting.
  I will help when and if I can, but I can not be held responsible for issues created while following this guide or performing any suggestions I make.

Thanks for checking out this guide.
